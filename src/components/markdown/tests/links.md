The syntax for links has two parts--the text label for the link (enclosed in square brackets)
immediately followed by path to which that text is linked (enclosed in parentheses).

Both [Internal links](/some/page/on/this/site) and [external links](https://www.google.com) have the same syntax.
Note that external links are automatically decorated with an icon and will open in a new tab.
