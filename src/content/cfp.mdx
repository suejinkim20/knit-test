# Calls for Action  

## Calls for Presentations
Call for Lightning Talks

KNIT9 attendees have the opportunity to present lightning talks on the following topics:

1.  Enabling experimentation in various science domains
2.  Getting started with FABRIC -- Unique features, useful tricks, sharable services
3.  Experiments across FABRIC and other testbeds
4.  Propose a compelling new topic

These talks should show active FABRIC experiment views and results. For planned experiments, we encourage presenting planned topology and resources (FABRIC and other) as specific as possible.

Submissions are due July 15 via ourÂ [submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1x-JXFHXTNgN6-wkqcoBcnFNAvkPdRSCIrX_poPTXazw/viewform?edit_requested=true).
